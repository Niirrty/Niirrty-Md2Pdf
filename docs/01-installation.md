UK.Md2Pdf is a tool that generates a PDF File from one or more markdown files.


# Installation

UK.Md2Pdf comes as a PHAR archive and can be called if a usable PHP7.1+ is known at your system.

Simple unpack `uk-md2pdf.zip` or `uk-md2pdf.tag.bz` to a place of your choice.

If you are done with it you have to make it globally usableâ€¦
